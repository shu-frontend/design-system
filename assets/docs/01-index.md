title: Sheffield Hallam University Design System
---

#### Our design principles establish the foundation of Sheffield Hallam’s digital presence, reflecting the University’s mission and core values. SHU’s digital outputs should be:

### Forward thinking
Our design system is not just for here and now. Longevity is essential. At all times, we consider the University’s strategy and future vision and the likely needs of our future users.
We don’t waste our own time. We consider how our design patterns may be used in future scenarios, reducing the need for additional design work at a later date. We reduce design and technical debt by taking no shortcuts and reducing the need for special cases.

### Flexible
Our design outputs must be responsive both to the needs of the University and to the needs of our online userbase.
We create design patterns that are reusable in other contexts by testing their use with varied content types and we make our design system sustainable by advocating for the reuse of existing patterns over the creation of additional ones.

### Supportive and Inclusive
We design for all of our users and start with their needs. All design output should solve a real user need in order to exist.
By regularly testing our assumptions with real end users of all physical and cognitive abilities, we ensure that all our design outputs are suitable for all users.
We create design patterns that allow our content team to offer additional support to users who may need it, whether that be due to a visual impairment or simply because the content of a page is difficult to understand.

### Confident
We’re proud of who we are and what we’re doing, so we’re not afraid to let the content do the talking. We don’t need to add fanciful animations or quirky shapes to engage our users.
The visual design of components and layouts is secondary in importance to the content that they hold. Every design element should have a purpose, just like every piece of content.
Keeping things clear and simple will allow our users to find the right information quickly and without unnecessary effort.
