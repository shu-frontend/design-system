# Island Atom

The island atom will color the background as per the class name, for example `.island--primary`. This can (and should) be combined with the `.u-inverse` utility to invert the colours within, for example, if you are using a `primary` island, you should invert the text within it for legibility.

The `.island--bordered` modifier will add a `1px` stroke to the bottom of the island that uses a 10% darkened version of the island color (if set).
